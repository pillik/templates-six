<div class="col-sm-5"><h2>Photo Gallery</h2><p>The Photo Gallery module builds beautiful 
photo galleries, which display great on Computers and on Mobile devices.</p>
<p>Responsive, well designed front-end, but also intuitive back-end for website admin. 
Easily upload new photos from local computer, drag & drop selected images for desired 
item order.</p>
<p>Gallery module can display single, defined gallery or a list of all galleries the 
user has created, but also instead of separate image blocks you can have a Slideshow mode or 
Collage mode.</p>
